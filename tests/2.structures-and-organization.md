# STRUCTURES AND ORGANIZATION

We can organize the test's code in three sections from BDD

**GIVEN** - Is the preparation of data and context of the test

**WHEN** - Is the interaction and the moment that something will act

**THEN** - Is what we expect from the data mixed with the action

```js

describe("Permissions store", () => {

  // DESCRIBERS: you can use to separate main logics, contexts...
  describe("actions", () => {

    it("should fetchPermissions and commit the data", async () => {
      // GIVEN
      const commit = jest.fn();
      const response = ["USER_EDIT", "USER_DELETE"];

      mockApiResponse(response);

      // WHEN
      await permissionStore.actions.fetchPermissions({ commit });

      // THEN
      expect(commit).toHaveBeenCalledWith("setPermissions", response);
    });
  });
});
```
