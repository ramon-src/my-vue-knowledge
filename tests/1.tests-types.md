# TESTS TYPES

Considering the pyramid of test we can have different types of tests
which are E2E, integration and component tests, and unit tests.

## UNIT TESTING

Unit tests are written to verify that small, isolated units of code are working as expected. A unit test usually covers a single function, class, composable, or module. Unit tests focus on logical correctness and only concern themselves with a small portion of the application's overall functionality. They may mock large parts of your application's environment (e.g. initial state, complex classes, 3rd party modules, and network requests).

In general, unit tests will catch issues with a function's business logic and logical correctness.

```js
// helpers.js
export function increment(current, max = 10) {
  if (current < max) {
    return current + 1;
  }
  return current;
}

// helpers.spec.js
import { increment } from "./helpers";

describe("increment", () => {
  test("increments the current number by 1", () => {
    expect(increment(0, 10)).toBe(1);
  });

  test("does not increment the current number over the max", () => {
    expect(increment(10, 10)).toBe(10);
  });

  test("has a default max of 10", () => {
    expect(increment(10)).toBe(10);
  });
});
```

## COMPONENT TESTING

Tests that are "Blackbox tests" are unaware of the implementation details of a component. These tests mock as little as possible to test the integration of your component and the entire system. They usually render all child components and are considered more of an "integration test".



### Visual tests

Assert correct render output based on inputted props and slots.

```js
import { mount } from "@vue/test-utils";

const MessageComponent = {
  template: "<p>{{ msg }}</p>",
  props: ["msg"],
};

describe("Message Component", () => {
  it("displays message", () => {
    const wrapper = mount(MessageComponent, {
      props: {
        msg: "Hello world",
      },
    });

    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain("Hello world");
  });
});
```

### Behavioral tests

Assert correct render updates or emitted events in response to user input events.

```js
import { mount } from "@vue/test-utils";

const MessageComponent = {
  template: '<p @click="remove">{{ msg }}</p>',
  props: ["msg", "id"],
  methods: {
    remove() {
      this.$emit("remove", this.id);
    },
  },
};

describe("Message Component", () => {
  it("should emit remove event on message click", () => {
    const wrapper = mount(MessageComponent, {
      props: {
        msg: "Hello world",
        id: 1,
      },
    });
    wrapper.trigger("click");

    expect(sprayingMenu.emitted("remove")).toEqual([1]);
  });
});
```
